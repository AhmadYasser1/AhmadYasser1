Computer Science graduate with a passion for bridging technology and real-world impact

I'm a dual-degree CS graduate from both University of Minnesota (4.0 GPA) and Egypt University of Informatics, combining American innovation with global perspectives. Currently making waves at BSE Global (Brooklyn Nets/Barclays Center) as a Digital Fellow, where I get to merge my love for sports, technology, and data.

My journey spans multiple domains - from developing machine learning models at Digital Egypt Investment Co. to researching word embeddings with professors at UMN's Carlson School, and even teaching AI concepts to kids aged 6-18. I thrive at the intersection of technical expertise and human connection.

Recent highlights:
- Full-ride scholarship recipient & Maximillian Lando Scholar
- Published research on interactive wellness devices (CHI 2025)
- Built The Arabic Pile dataset (300GB+) advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Arabic
- Led coding bootcamps and managed chatbot projects that boosted customer support by 80%

I speak fluent English and Arabic, and I'm passionate about using technology to solve real business challenges - whether that's optimizing sports analytics, advancing AI research, or building products that matter.

What drives me: Creating technology that brings people together, just like sports taught me growing up. From the basketball court to the data center, I believe the best solutions come from teamwork and diverse perspectives.

Currently exploring opportunities in data science, AI research, or product management where I can combine technical skills with business impact. Always open to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, sports fans, or anyone who loves a good data story!

Let's connect - I'd love to chat about sports analytics, AI innovations, or how we can use tech to build something amazing together. ü§ù
